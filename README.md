RockPaperBoom
=============

Rock Paper BOOM is a rock-paper-scisors game that is played by programable "bots".

##The Story

At a [Hudson Software Craftsmanship](http://hudsonsc.com/) meeting, we got on the topic of games for programmers where code is involved.

A couple members pointed out that Microsoft once did a game called "Rock Paper Azure."

We took the idea and whipped up a quick node.js server to do the same thing, and in our September 2014 meeting, we spent a couple hours hacking on the server and making bots.
It was a blast!

##The Appologies

The code is probably in a rough state. Please submit pull requests!

There is also no security or anything. The server was made avaialble on the local intranet, not open to the public. It is totally hackable.

##Running It

1. Install node.js
2. Open a command prompt / shell and go to the directory where this repo is cloned
3. run > `npm install` one time to download the dependencies.
4. run > `npm start` to start the server
5. open a browser to `localhost:4000`
